# Horoscli

### Installation

```
bundle install
rake
```

The most important file is lib/horoscli.rb. It offers an example
of how to use the Rueph library in your code.

The horoscli.rb in the project directory is mostly an option parser.

This entire project itself is very, very much a work in progress
(by an inexperienced programmer) if you have suggestions, advice, or questions
please open an issue or (preferably!) send me an email at parkermcgowan@horos.today

Also, see [rueph](https://github.com/jsphnecclia/rueph), if that's not how you got to this page in the first place.
