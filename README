# Rueph & Horoscli
#TODO
#replace wget -P with equivalent curl command

## Pre-Installation
```
bundle install
rake c_build
rake get_ephe
```


## Installation

There are several different methods of installation based on what your purposes are

All installations require installation of the libswe.so library file and some
ephemeris files.
 
Install the library thusly:

```
wget https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/swe_unix_src_2.10.02.tar.gz
tar xvf swe_unix_src_2.10.02.tar.gz
cd src && make libswe.so
# mv src/libswe.so /usr/local/lib/libswe.so
rm -rf src
rm -rf doc
rm swe_unix_src_2.09.03.tar.gz 
```

and the ephemeris files:
```
mkdir ephe
wget -P ephe https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/seas_12.se1
wget -P ephe https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/seas_18.se1
wget -P ephe https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/sefstars.txt
wget -P ephe https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/semo_12.se1
wget -P ephe https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/semo_18.se1
wget -P ephe https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/sepl_12.se1
wget -P ephe https://www.astro.com/ftp/swisseph/ephe/sepl_18.se1
```

if you just want to use horoscli, install the horoscli gem.

if you want to hack around on horoscli,...
but please, do share what you make!

if you are planning to build a program using rueph, eventually you will use
the rueph gem. However, it is recommended that before that you take a deep
look into the horoscli example program as well as the foreign function
interface itself in rueph.rb and ruephbase.rb. Hack around on those two files,
but please, do share what you make!
